-- Heroku --
0. Combine FRONT and BACK files into one directory
1. Make sure GIT is installed
2. Download Heroku CLI

3. .git folder should be inside root directory (perntodoauth_heroku).
    Inside Bash Terminal, reveal hidden folders with command 'ls -a'
    if .git isnt there, run 'git init'

4. Heroku is flexible with file structure, but you MUST have a package.json file in root directory.
    Do this by bringing all contents of backend folder into root directory.
